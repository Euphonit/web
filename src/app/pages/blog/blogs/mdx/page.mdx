    I'm on a roadtrip as of writing this, and I have ***a lot*** of time on my hands so I decided to update the website!
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 1. Rounded Corners</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
    I love modern designs, especially the design of Apple products. So I went around and made a lot of elements rounded to give them a nicer look in general. I think it came out great!

    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 2. Better Buttons</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
        This change isn't very noticeable to the end-user, but I've replaced `<p>` elements with `<button>` elements wrapped in Next.js `<Link>` tags. I believe this will allow for more customizability in the future.

    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 3. MDX</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
    I learned about MDX from a YouTube video as a way to write blogs more easily. Since I love Markdown, I thought this would be a **great** tool to integrate. It seemed like it would be easy to implement as well. According to various sources online, it *should* be straightforward. The only snag I've hit is that MDX by default wraps my content in a `<p>` tag, which prevents me from using Markdown headings. I'm sure there's a simple fix for this, but I haven't figured it out yet.
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 4. Password API</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
        For all the password-protected pages, I have an internal API that handles the authentication. I've significantly improved its security by storing the password in an environment file instead of hardcoding it directly into the password function.

    I hope you enjoy the website update! If you have any feedback, feel free to email me at dancrutti@gmail.com.
