    I'm on a roadtrip as of writing this, and I have ***alot*** of time on my hands so I decided to update the website!
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 1. Rounded Corners</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
    I love modern designs. Especially the design of apple products. So I went around and made alot of elements rounded and just have a nicer look in general. I think it came out great!
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 2. Better Buttons</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
        So this one isn't really noticible as an end-user thing, but I am not using `<button>` elements instead of `<p>` with Nextjs `<Link>` tags wrapped in them. I think this should help the website have more customizability.
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 3. MDX</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
    I heard about MDX on youtube as a way to write blogs easier. I love markdown so I thought this would be a **great** tool to add. I also thought it would be easy to implement. According to most places online it _should_ be easy implement. The only issue is that MDX chooses to wrap my content in a `<p>` tag. This means I can't use Markdown headings. I know there is probaly some super simple way around this, but i'm to stupid to figure it out.
    </div>
    <div className="--font-poppins antialiased font-medium text-center text-5xl text-clip flex items-start mt-1"> 4. Password API</div>
    <div className="mt-2">
        So for all the passworded pages I have an internal API that does all the auth stuff. I made it alot more secure by keeping the password in an env file instead of hardcoded into the password function.
    </div>

    I hope you enjoy the website update! If you have an feedback feel free to email me at dancrutti@gmail.com
